This is the README file in the $NUPACKHOME/doc/examples directory
of the NUPACK 3.2 source code

5 March 2017

The directory structure of $NUPACKHOME/doc/examples 
is as follows: 

complex-analysis
   simple, advanced, pseudoknot
	runjobs, input, output, output.ref

complex-design
   simple, advanced
	runjobs, input, output, output.ref

tube-analysis
   simple, advanced
	runjobs, input, output, output.ref

tube-design 
   simple, advanced
	runjobs, input, output, output.ref

multitube-design
   simple, advanced
	runjobs, input, output, output.ref
	

Five subdirectories (complex-analysis, complex-design, tube-analysis, tube-design, multitube-design)
correspond to different problem classes. 

Within each of these, three subdirectories (simple, advanced, pseudoknot) 
or two subdirectories (simple, advanced) correspond to different sample calculations.  

Within each of these, there is a shell script (runjobs) and 
three subdirectories containing job files (input, output, output.ref). 

Run the shell script "runjobs" to call multiple NUPACK executables,
reading input files from the directory "input" and 
writing output files to the directory "output". The generated results
in directory "output" can be compared to the reference results 
in directory "output.ref" to check that your local installation 
of NUPACK 3.2 is running properly. 

Alternatively, in directory $NUPACKHOME/doc/examples, run the script "runall"
to run all of the "runjobs" scripts (a total of 11 "runjobs" scripts).
Then run the script "diffall" to compare the files in the "output" directories with the 
corresponding files in the "output.ref" directories.

#
# This script runs NUPACK executables for test tube design 
#
# The target test tube contains 1 on-target dimer 
# (with a target structure and target concentration)
# plus all off-target complexes of up to 2 strands 
# (each with vanishing target concentration)
#
# Material is DNA, temperature is 37 C

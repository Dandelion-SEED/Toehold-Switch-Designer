#
# This script runs NUPACK executables to perform test tube design 
# for an HCR system described in Dirks and Pierce, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2004
#
# The target test tube contains 2 on-target monomers and 1 on-target trimer 
# (each with a target structure and target concentration)
# plus all off-target complexes of up to 3 strands 
# (each with vanishing target concentration)
#
# Material is DNA, temperature is 23 C
